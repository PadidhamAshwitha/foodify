# Foodify

---

 Foodify is a Swiggy inspired food delivery application. Done this project with a good understandings of the core concepts of React such as Functional Components, Class based Components, hooks and created custom hooks to make code modular and to have Single Responsibility. I have used React, Redux, Tailwind CSS and API's to build this Project.
 Through this project I gained a deeper understanding of React and how SRP(single Responsibility Principle), hooks, functional components etc allows us to reuse components. And Enhanced my knowledge in fundamentals of web development concepts
